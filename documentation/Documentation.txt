General Setup:
Uses the pygame library for 2D game development.
Game window resolution: 1280x720 pixels.
Background with scaled image and CRT-style overlay effect.

Player Mechanics:

Player-controlled paddle with movement constrained to screen boundaries.
Can upgrade abilities (speed, size, health, lasers).
Displays a laser array as visual indicators.

Ball Mechanics:

Starts inactive; activated by pressing the spacebar.
Collides with blocks, the player paddle, and window boundaries.
Handles collisions with different effects (e.g., direction reversal, damage to blocks).

Blocks:

Multiple types of blocks, each with a health level and a color.
Blocks are destroyed when their health reaches zero, with a chance to spawn upgrades.
Upgrades:

Types: speed, laser, heart, size.
Collected by colliding with the player paddle.
Enhance player abilities dynamically during gameplay.

Projectiles:

Shoot lasers using the paddle's laser array.
Lasers interact with blocks to deal damage and destroy them.
Game Logic:

Tracks player health (hearts).
Ends the game when health reaches zero.
Music, sound effects (laser, collision, power-ups), and volume control are implemented.

Block Layout:

Predefined block map with gaps between blocks for level design.
Flexible scaling of block sizes based on the window and map configuration.

Graphics and Styling:

Dynamic surfaces created for blocks, player paddle, and other assets using SurfaceMaker.
Includes vignette-style CRT overlay for a retro aesthetic.


Requirements:

Hardware/Software - Python 3.x with the pygame library installed.
The system has sufficient resolution to display a 1280x720 window.

Assets - Image files for blocks, upgrades, paddle, ball, projectiles, and background.
Sound files for music, lasers, impact, failure, and power-ups.

Code Organization - Modular structure with separate settings, sprites, surface generation, and main game loop files.
Expandable upgrade and block types using dictionaries and lists.

Gameplay Controls - Arrow keys for paddle movement.
Spacebar to activate the ball or fire lasers.
