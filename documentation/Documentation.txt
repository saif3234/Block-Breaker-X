General Setup:
Uses the pygame library for 2D game development.
Game window resolution: 1280x720 pixels.
Background with scaled image and CRT-style overlay effect.

Player Mechanics:

Player-controlled paddle with movement constrained to screen boundaries.
Can upgrade abilities (speed, size, health, lasers).
Displays a laser array as visual indicators.

Ball Mechanics:

Starts inactive; activated by pressing the spacebar.
Collides with blocks, the player paddle, and window boundaries.
Handles collisions with different effects (e.g., direction reversal, damage to blocks).

Blocks:

Multiple types of blocks, each with a health level and a color.
Blocks are destroyed when their health reaches zero, with a chance to spawn upgrades.
Upgrades:

Types: speed, laser, heart, size.
Collected by colliding with the player paddle.
Enhance player abilities dynamically during gameplay.

Projectiles:

Shoot lasers using the paddle's laser array.
Blocks are damaged and destroyed by laser interaction.

Logic of Games:

keeps track of players' hearts.
Upon reaching 0 health, the game is terminated.
Volume control, sound effects (such as laser, collision, and power-ups), and music are all included.

Block Arrangement:

A pre-made block map for level creation that has spaces between blocks.
Block size scaling is flexible and depends on the map and window setup.

Style and Graphics:

Using SurfaceMaker, dynamic surfaces were produced for the player paddle, blocks, and other elements.
has a vignette-style CRT overlay for a vintage look.

Needs:

Python 3.x with the pygame library installed is the hardware/software combination.
The resolution of the machine is adequate to show a window that is 1280x720.

Assets:
Picture files for the backdrop, paddle, ball, missiles, blocks, upgrades, and more.
Music, lasers, impact, failure, and power-up sound files.

Code Organisation: 
The core game loop files, sprites, settings, and surface generation are all organised in a modular fashion.
Using dictionaries and lists, expandable upgrade and block types are possible.

Arrow keys are used to move the paddle throughout the game.
Use the spacebar to shoot lasers or activate the ball.
